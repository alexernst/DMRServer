DMRServer
========================================================================================================

The DMRServer component provides self hosted TalkGroups with custom DMR user ids, that may be the same
of different from radio assigned ids.  The password can be set to be either shared for all hotspot, 
or administered for each user.

The DMRServer can be installed on any server that will be reachable by the Hotspots that will connect.
This would include public internet servers like AWS in the free tier for limited use, or other cloud
server providers. If can also be installed on a desktop PC or Raspberrypi, and make accessable from the 
internet by configuring incoming firewall rules on the designated port. (62031 by default).

To run the DMRServer you need the following files on the target server:

	DMRServer.jar
	auth.properties

The command line to run is:

	java  -jar DMRServer.jar -port 62033 -serverkey abcdefghijk0123456789

The serverkey is optional and only needed to provide encryption between the DMRMultiConnect component
and the server.  It will not likely work when encryption is enabled with any other DMR 
clients, like DROIDSTAR.  So leave this off if you need other types of clients to connect.
You need to install the "openjdk-11-jdk" java package to run



========================================================================================================
DMRMultiConnect
========================================================================================================

The DMRMultiConnect component allows a Hotspot to subscribe to multiple DMR Talk Group hosts, including
well known providers like Brandmeister and TGIF, and also supports multiple private DMRServer instances.  
It is not limited to a number of services, but only 5-6 concurrent services have been tested so far.

The DMRMultiConnect process can run on the same raspberrypi as the host spot, or on a different PC.  When 
running on the same host, the IP is set to the local loopback 127.0.0.1 address.  For a seperate host, you 
would need to configure the IP of the PC host.

The required files are:

	DMRMultiConnect.jar
	auth.properties   (must have a password configured for MMDVMHost to connect)
	multi_connect.ini

The command line to run is:

	java  -jar DMRMultiConnect.jar  -config multi_connect.ini


If you run this on a pi-star, you need to install the "openjdk-11-jdk" java package to run.  You may need
to use the expert configuration mode to add the IP address of you DMRMultiConnect.  It has also been 
tested running on a stock raspberian OS pi with only the MMDVMHost package installed.  The included MMDVM.ini
reference file will work in this mode, but many of the other web based pi-star services will not be available.
